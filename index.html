         <h2>What I hope to learn!</h2>
         <p>  I would like to learn the basics of java and how to convert java easily into other programming languages. I would also like to be able to program my robot in robotics by the end of this class. What I mean by that is I hope to be able to make an autnomous program for my robot to do the objective on its own. </p>
