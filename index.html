            <em>Why am I taking Computer Science?</em> I am taking the Computer Science class to expand my knowledge base on programming computers.I personally plan to get a college degree in computer programming an any oppurtuntiy that I have to learn more is one I will take. I would like to learn the basics of java and how to convert java easily into other programming languages. I would also like to be able to program my robot in robotics by the end of this class.

      I enjoy many video games during my free time such as Minecraft, Rocket League, and Among Us. I manily play these games so that I am able to spend time with friends while we arent able to get together in person. When I am actually able to hangout with friends, we often times play Dungeons and Dragons, which is so much fun! When I have some free time to my self, I enjoy drawing. Even though most of my drawings arent that great, I still love to draw! Those are a lot of things that I personally enjoy doing, do you enjoy any of them?
