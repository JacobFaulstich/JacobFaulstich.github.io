            <em>Why am I taking Computer Science?</em> I am taking the Computer Science class to expand my knowledge base on programming computers.I personally plan to get a college degree in computer programming an any oppurtuntiy that I have to learn more is one I will take. I would like to learn the basics of java and how to convert java easily into other programming languages. I would also like to be able to program my robot in robotics by the end of this class.
