   I enjoy many video games during my free time such as Minecraft, Rocket League, and Among Us. I manily play these games so that I am able to spend time with friends while we arent able to get together in person. When I am actually able to hangout with friends, we often times play Dungeons and Dragons, which is so much fun! When I have some free time to my self, I enjoy drawing. Even though most of my drawings arent that great, I still love to draw! Those are a lot of things that I personally enjoy doing, do you enjoy any of them?

   <h2>My Personality</h2>
   <!-- This makes a paragraph which I wrote stuff about my personality-->
   <p>
       I took the 16 personality test on 16personalites.com and my personality turend out to be a Turbulent Consul! The description for this personality type is  "At their hearts, Consul personalities are social creatures, and thrive on staying up to date with what their friends are doing." It says that a consul likes to be puplar and at the center of attention. I agree with this description of me because I love hanging out with others and thats my go to with free time! Any time that I hangout with friends and family is a good time!

       <h2>Extra Stuff</h2>
       <!--This makes a paragraph where I wrote about what I want to do after shcool and what makes me, me-->
       <p>After High school I plan on going to college to major in some type of engineering! In school I really enjoy Science class which goes well with wanting to do engineering! Something that makes me is that I care lots about others and how they feel. I may get anxious about what others think about me but I am working hard to be fine with who I am!</p>
