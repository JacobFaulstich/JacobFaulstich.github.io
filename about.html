   I enjoy many video games during my free time such as Minecraft, Rocket League, and Among Us. I manily play these games so that I am able to spend time with friends while we arent able to get together in person. When I am actually able to hangout with friends, we often times play Dungeons and Dragons, which is so much fun! When I have some free time to my self, I enjoy drawing. Even though most of my drawings arent that great, I still love to draw! Those are a lot of things that I personally enjoy doing, do you enjoy any of them?
